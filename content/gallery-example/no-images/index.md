Hey!

Thanks for stopping by today.

I'm a North Perth-based photographer with a love of big dogs, loving people, jaw-dropping landscapes, and snuggling into my recliner with a glass of red and a bowl of warmth. Oh and baking. I don't mind baking when the mood strikes.

## My Story

I guess I've always had an interest in the visual - I remember when I was a kid living in Canberra I got my first film point and shoot camera. Taking photos during the four distinct seasons of Canberra was probably the highlight of the two year stay there - The fresh, white snow on Mount Kosciuszko; a million colours in a field of green during Floriade; a clear blue sky from Mount Ainslie; to the crunchy, burnt orange leaves lining the roads.

I so loved being able to capture what I saw to recall upon later. I still do. 
Recently I've decided there's not much I'd rather do than to be photographing, so this is now my biggest priority in life after my people.  Besides living in Canberra for almost two years, I am a Perth/Mandurah girl. I was born and primarily raised here and will likely always call Western Australia home.
